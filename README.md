## Project Overview

This project is a small 2D game developed over a three-week winter break by a team of classmates and myself. The game combines mining mechanics with bullet-hell combat, challenging players to gather resources while surviving increasingly chaotic enemy encounters.

Players mine ore veins that drop currency, which can be spent on upgrades through an in-game shop. While the original concept included crafting and resource refinement systems, the scope was intentionally reduced to ensure the project reached a complete and playable state within the limited timeframe.

## Technical Highlights

- Built using the Godot Engine  
- Implemented early procedural level generation using Perlin noise  
- Designed and animated custom sprite assets  
- Developed projectile systems, enemy behaviors, and collision handling using Godot’s collision layers  
- Worked in a collaborative Git environment, resolving merge conflicts and coordinating feature development  

## Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience using version control in a team setting, including resolving merge conflicts  
- Developed a stronger understanding of scope management and feature prioritization  
- Improved understanding of real-time collision systems and projectile behavior  
- Experienced the time and effort required for asset creation and animation  

## Future Improvements

If development were to continue, potential improvements include:

- Expanding enemy variety and attack patterns  
- Improving visual polish and animation consistency  
- Revisiting procedural generation to increase level variety  
- Adding deeper progression systems such as crafting, expanded upgrades, and difficulty scaling
