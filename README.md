**Project Overview**

This project is a small 2D game developed over a three-week winter break by a team of classmates and myself. The game blends mining mechanics with bullet-hell combat, challenging players to collect resources while surviving increasingly chaotic enemy encounters.

Players mine ore veins that drop currency used to purchase upgrades from an in-game shop. While the original design included crafting and resource refinement, the scope was intentionally reduced to ensure a complete and playable experience within the time constraint.

**Technical Highlights**

-Built using Godot Engine

-Implemented procedural level generation using Perlin Noise (early prototype)

-Designed custom animation and sprite assets

-Implemented projectile systems, enemy behaviors, and collision handling using Godot’s collision layers

-Worked in a team Git environment, resolving merge conflicts and coordinating feature development

**Key Learnings**

-Gained hands-on experience with version control in a collaborative setting, including resolving merge conflicts
  
-Learned practical constraints of game scope management

-Improved understanding of real-time collision systems and projectile behavior

-Experienced the time cost of asset creation and animation firsthand

**Future Improvements**

If continued, I would:

-Expand enemy variety and attack patterns

-Improve visual polish and animation consistency

-Revisit procedural generation to increase level variety

-Add more meaningful progression systems (crafting, upgrades, scaling difficulty)
