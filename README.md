This was a small game a couple classmates and I created over our winter break (3 weeks).

It's a mining game, but also a bullet hell game?
We meant to have the veins drop ore that could be used to sell/craft but ended up just having the veins drop gold coins so players could purchase stuff from the shop.

Off topic note:
We encountered several merge conflicts, which was a good learning experience for me. Also game development is not as easy as you would think, but with AI it's easy to pump stuff out, even if it's garbage.

I experimented with Perlin Noise level generation but that never really panned out, I only invested about an hour of my time into it.
The animation and sprites took up a enormous amount of time sadly... I didn't want to just borrow other peoples art though. Idk what my problem is.
The one tile set we did find, basically crashed Godot, so I just made some smaller tiles for testing.

Getting projectiles to behave was fun. Collision layers is an interesting mechanism...

I think in the future (if I continue working on this) I'll really flesh out more mobs (for now it's just moles. Lots of moles) And more variety when it comes to attacks (for player and from enemies)
Additionally, I would like to clean up a lot of the animations and art. It could be something nice to look at with some concerted effort and a good amount of time.
